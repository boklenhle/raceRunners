# raceRunners
This project checks the runner's age and if they registered early.
It also assigns a race number. 

The race number is randomized with JavaScript's built in Math functionality. If the runner is a minor (under 18), they get a random number under 1000. If the runner is an adult (over 18), they get a random number over 1000.
